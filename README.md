# C#-Programming
The starting course at the ITHS .NET program.
I started the program with a basic understanding of programming, but not much practical knowledge. The course involved three projects with growing complexity.

The three projects helps to show the development that took place in a short time. From learning about the basics of a foor loop, to developing an app with a graphical interface and reading and writing to files. 
Some key takeways for me was the importance of planning the project well to save time in the long run, and not the feel overwhelmed at the new knowledge needed to complete the project. At the start there was a lot of new technical terms and concepts needed, but by applying patience and breaking down the project progress could be made.
